# Ravenous #
A project for learning React.

## Project Progress ##
See how this code progressed throughout my course:

[Ravenous I - Create Static Components - Day 7](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-1)
* I've built three components: `Business`, `BusinessList`, and `SearchBar`.
* The `App` component renders a `SearchBar` component and a `BusinessList` component.
* This is just a simulation of what the finished project will look like.
* Business information is currently hardcoded, but later I'll be querying the Yelp API.

[Ravenous II - Pass Information - Day 10](https://github.com/bgrapes/ravenous/tree/ravenous-2)
* I've moved business information to the container component `App`.
* Business information is now passed from the parent `App` component to the child components `Business` and `BusinessList`.
